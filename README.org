* Recipes

Recipes are just a set of related packages. Selecting recipes for different
machines is more conventient than selecting all packages one by one.

Some recipes need environment variables. There will be checked when
==requiring== the recipe. When an enviroment variable is missing, the
provisioning process will be halted before it has begon.
